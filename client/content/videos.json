    "blurb": "Mel (male) & Sydney (female), are a mating pair of barn owls located in Oceanside, California. The owl box owner is originally from Melbourne, Australia. The box was set up in mid November 2010 and the owls could be seen in the box just two weeks later. This owl box is 16ft above the ground in the owners back yard which is near acres of open wilderness. This provides for plenty of hunting grounds for the owls. Incubation is 30-34 days from the date each egg is laid. Unlike chickens, Barn Owls begin to incubate immediately after the 1st egg is laid. Each egg will hatch on a different day. All time is in PST(Pacific Standard Time)."

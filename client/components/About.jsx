      The Wild Animal Initiative aims to raise awareness about and reduce the suffering of animals. Some bird nest cams are monitored for the chicks' welfare, but many are not. Our goal is to empower public nest cam viewers to contribute to our research. By recording their observations of life in the nest, viewers enable our researchers to study the development of the birds. Visit a nest cam below to contribute to our work.
